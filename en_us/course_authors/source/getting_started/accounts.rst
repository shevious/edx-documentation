Getting Started with edX

The following sections provide an introduction to edX and instructions for
getting started on edX websites.

* :ref:`edX.org and edX Edge`
* :ref:`Create an Account`
* :ref:`edX101_section`

This information is intended for course staff. You might want to include the
details about the registration process and password policies in your
communications with prospective students.

For information about enrolling students in a course, see
:ref:`enroll_student`.

.. _edX.org and edX Edge:

*************************
edx.org and edX Edge
*************************

To explore edX courses, you can register an account on the edx.org_ website,
the edX Edge_ website, or both. These sites are visually and functionally
similar, but their content and purposes are different.

* edx.org hosts massive open online courses (MOOCs) from edX institutional
  partners. To publish a course on edx.org, you must have an agreement with edX
  and specific approval from your organization. Courses on edx.org are publicly
  listed in the edX course catalog and are open to learners from around the
  world.

* Edge, at edge.edx.org, is a more private site. Courses on Edge are not
  published on edx.org. Any member of a partner course team can create and
  publish courses, including test courses, on Edge without receiving approval
  from edX or a partner institution.

  However, Edge does not have a course catalog, and courses cannot be found
  through search engines such as Google. Only learners whom you explicitly
  invite or who have the URL for your course can participate in your course on
  Edge. Note that you can invite an unlimited number of learners to participate
  in an Edge course.

  EdX Edge also hosts small private online courses (SPOCs).

.. note:: 
 All course data and user accounts on Edge and edx.org are separate. If you
 want to use both edx.org and Edge, you must complete the account registration
 process on both sites.

.. _Create an Account:

*************************
Create an Account
*************************

To create, or register, an account on edx.org or Edge, follow these steps.  

#. Go to the `edx.org registration`_ or `Edge registration`_ page.

#. Optionally, use one of your existing accounts to sign in. 

  - On edx.org, you can use your Facebook or Google account.

  - On Edge, you can use your Facebook or Google account, or use your
    credentials for a campus or institution account.

  Choosing one of these options links your new edx.org or Edge account to the
  selected existing account. When you choose one of these options, some of the
  information required for your new edx.org or Edge account is typically
  provided for you to streamline the registration process. When you sign in to
  the linked account you are automatically signed in to the edx.org or Edge
  account.

3. On the registration page, enter the required information for your new
   account. Fields with an asterisk (*) are required.

  - If you are at an edX partner institution, supply your institutional email
    address.

  - Learners and other course team members see the name that you enter in the
    **Public username** field, not the name in the **Full name** field.

4. Select the applicable check box or boxes to accept the terms of service and
   honor code.

#. Select **Create**. An activation message is sent to your email address.

#. In the activation email message, select the link to complete the activation.
   Your browser opens to an "Activation Complete" page that contains a link to
   your dashboard.

You can modify your account information, reset your password, and link or
unlink accounts on the :ref:`account settings<SFD Account Settings>` page. Note
that you can only access the account settings page from the LMS, and not from
Studio.

******************************
The edX Demo Course and edX101
******************************

EdX provides the edX Demo course and Overview of Creating an edX Course 
to help familiarize you with taking and creating edX courses.

* The `edX Demo course`_ allows new students to explore and learn how to take
  an edX course. We recommend that you become familiar with the way students
  experience an edX course before you begin building your first course.

  .. note::
    You can include information about the edX Demo course in your course
    materials, and recommend that new learners take the edX Demo course before
    proceeding with your course.

* `Overview of Creating an edX Course`_ is an example of a course built with
  Studio. It is a self-paced walk-through of planning, building, and running
  your own online course.
